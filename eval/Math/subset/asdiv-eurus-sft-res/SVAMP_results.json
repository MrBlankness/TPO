first find out how many push-ups David did and then determine how many push-ups John did.\nStep 2:  We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can calculate David's push-ups by adding 39 to Zachary's 15 push-ups. This gives us 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups for David.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find out how many push-ups John did. We're told that John did 9 push-ups less than David, so we subtract 9 from David's 54 push-ups. This gives us 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups for John.\nStep 4:  Now, to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's push-ups from Zachary's. This gives us 15 - 45 = -30 push-ups.\nStep 5:  However, since we can't have a negative number of push-ups, we need to re-evaluate our calculations. It seems there was a mistake in our subtraction, and we need to re-calculate the number of push-ups Zachary did more than John.\nStep 6:  Upon re-evaluating, we find that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups.
